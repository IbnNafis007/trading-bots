======================================================
This project is intended to create bots that utilize exchange APIs and browser automators to implement fundamental economics trading methods in the true OOP style. Theexchanges directory contains class definitions for exchanges, including all relevantconstructors, accessors and mutators, using encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, nd overriding. In the trading-methods directory, there are programs that use the classes to implement their respective algorithm! For further information about each individual trading method, including set up and the algorithm behind it, click on the trading-methods directory and read the secondary README.
