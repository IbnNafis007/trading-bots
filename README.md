=============================================================================
This project is intended to create bots that utilize exchange APIs and web scrapers to 
implement fundamental economics trading methods in the true DRY OOP style. The exchanges 
directory contains class definitions for exchanges, including all relevant constructors,
accessors and mutators, using encapsulation. In the trading-methods directory, there
are programs that use the classes to implement their respective algorithm!
