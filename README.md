======================================================
This project is intended to create bots that utilize exchange APIs and browser automation to implement fundamental economics trading methods in the true OOP style. The exchanges directory contains class definitions for exchanges, including all relevant constructors, accessors and mutators, using encapsulation, inheritance, and overriding. In the trading-methods directory, there are programs that use the classes to implement their respective algorithm! Some may be encrypted to limit users without becoming a private repository.
